description: Hardware recommendations, Proxmox VE setup, Docker installation, and network topology for the home lab.

## Overview

This section covers everything you need to go from bare metal to a working home lab platform. By the end, you will have Proxmox VE installed on your server, Docker running inside VMs and LXC containers, and a clear understanding of how the network fits together.

## What you will build

A single physical server running Proxmox VE as the hypervisor, hosting multiple virtual machines and containers, each dedicated to a specific workload:

| VM / LXC        | Purpose                                 | Key requirement                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| AI VM           | LLM inference, TTS, image generation    | NVIDIA GPU passthrough         |
| Media VM        | Jellyfin, automated downloading         | GPU transcoding, large storage |
| Gaming VM       | Sunshine + Steam cloud gaming           | GPU passthrough, low latency   |
| Blockchain VM   | LUKSO full node (Geth + Lighthouse)     | 100GB+ SSD, stable network     |
| Deployment LXC  | Dokploy PaaS (Traefik, Postgres, Redis) | Ports 80/443 available         |
| Development LXC | Coder cloud workspaces                  | Docker socket access           |

## Recommended hardware

These are minimum and recommended specs for running the full stack. You can start with less if you only need a subset of services.

| Component    | Minimum              | Recommended             |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| CPU          | 8 cores / 16 threads | 16+ cores / 32 threads  |
| RAM          | 32 GB                | 64+ GB                  |
| Boot drive   | 256 GB SSD           | 512 GB NVMe             |
| Data storage | 1 TB HDD             | 2+ TB NVMe or SSD array |
| GPU          | NVIDIA GTX 1060      | NVIDIA RTX 3070+        |
| Network      | 1 Gbps               | 2.5 Gbps                |

The NVIDIA GPU is required for AI inference (Ollama, ComfyUI), media transcoding (Jellyfin), and game streaming (Sunshine). AMD GPUs are not covered by this guide.
