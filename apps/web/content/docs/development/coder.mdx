## Overview

Coder runs as a service on an LXC container and manages Docker-based workspaces. Each workspace is a container with a persistent home volume, pre-configured tools, and VS Code running in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on the host ([installation guide](/docs/getting-started/docker-installation))
- A domain pointed at the host (optional, for HTTPS access)

## Installation

```bash
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

For detailed installation options, see the [Coder install docs](https://coder.com/docs/install).

## Creating a workspace

### Via CLI

```bash
# Push the template (one-time)
cd infra/coder/template
coder templates push web3-dev-workspace

# Create workspace
coder create --template web3-dev-workspace my-workspace

# Connect via SSH
coder ssh my-workspace
```

### Via Web UI

1. Go to your Coder dashboard
2. Navigate to **Templates** and select `web3-dev-workspace`
3. Click **Create Workspace**
4. Optionally set a dotfiles repository URL
5. Wait for the workspace to build (3-5 minutes on first boot, 30-60 seconds on subsequent starts)

## Workspace features

Once inside a workspace, you have access to:

| Tool | Details |
|---|---|
| VS Code Server | 19 pre-installed extensions, accessible in browser |
| Node.js | Versions 18, 20, 22, 24 (default: 24) via version switcher |
| PNPM | Latest version, installed on first boot |
| Docker | Full access via host socket mount |
| Foundry | forge, cast, anvil, chisel for Solidity development |
| act | Run GitHub Actions locally |
| GitHub CLI | Auto-authenticated via Coder external auth |
| PostgreSQL 16 | Local database (user: coder, db: coder) |
| ZSH | Oh My Zsh with Powerlevel10k and plugins |
| OpenCode | AI coding assistant with web UI |
| File Browser | Web-based file manager |

## Shell aliases

Pre-configured aliases available in ZSH:

```bash
d           # docker
dc          # docker-compose
g           # git
gs          # git status
gp          # git pull
gc          # git commit
gco         # git checkout
ll          # ls -lah
k           # kubectl
```

Git aliases:

```bash
git st      # status
git co      # checkout
git br      # branch
git cm      # commit
git lg      # pretty log graph
```

## Resource limits

Default workspace resources:

| Resource | Default | Configurable |
|---|---|---|
| Memory | 8 GB | Yes, via `main.tf` |
| CPU | 4 cores | Yes, via `main.tf` |
| Swap | 16 GB | Automatic (2x memory) |
| Home volume | Persistent | Survives workspace restarts |

## Workspace monitoring

Coder tracks workspace metrics automatically:

- CPU and RAM usage (workspace and host)
- Home disk usage
- Host load average and swap
- Workspace size on disk

These are visible in the Coder dashboard under each workspace.

## Troubleshooting

**Docker not accessible inside workspace**: Check that `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted. Run `docker info` to verify.

**Tools not installing on first boot**: Check the startup script logs in the Coder UI under **Templates > Logs**. Network issues can prevent downloads.

**Workspace won't start**: Check `coder server logs` and `docker logs <container>` for errors.
