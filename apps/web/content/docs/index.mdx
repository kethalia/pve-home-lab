## What is this?

A self-hosted home lab built on [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview), running a collection of Docker-based services across multiple VMs and LXC containers. Everything is defined as code — Docker Compose files, Terraform templates, shell scripts — and documented here.

## Architecture

│   └── ComfyUI (image generation)
├── VM: Media Server (GPU transcoding)
│   ├── Jellyfin (media player)
│   ├── Gluetun (VPN gateway)
│   ├── qBittorrent (downloads)
│   └── Radarr / Sonarr / Prowlarr / Bazarr
├── VM: Gaming (GPU passthrough)
│   └── Sunshine + Steam (cloud gaming)
├── VM: Blockchain
│   ├── Geth (execution client)
│   ├── Lighthouse (consensus client)
│   └── Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring)
├── LXC: Deployment
│   └── Dokploy (PaaS with Traefik)
├── LXC: Development
│   └── Coder (cloud dev environments)
└── VPS: Public Proxy
    ├── WireGuard (VPN tunnel)
